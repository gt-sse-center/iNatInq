"""Shared pytest configuration and fixtures.

This module provides global fixtures and configuration that are available
to all tests in the test suite.

Fixtures defined here are automatically available to all tests without explicit
import statements. Keep fixtures small, composable, and focused on
seup/teardown.  Do NOT put business logic in fixtures.
